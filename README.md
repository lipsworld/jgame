# JGame

## Step 1: Set up the application directory structure

We have an HTML file in jgame.html which will be our entry point into the application, and which is set up to import all the CSS and JavaScript, then the following directories

* css - for all jgame CSS files
* src - for all jgame JavaScript files
* vendor - for all libraries and other 3rd party bits we'll use (like bootstrap and jquery)
